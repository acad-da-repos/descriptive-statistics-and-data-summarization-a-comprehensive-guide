# Descriptive Statistics and Data Summarization Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will practice calculating descriptive statistics and summarizing data using Pandas. These are fundamental skills for understanding the basic features of a dataset.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find a function definition: `summarize_data(df)`.
3.  Your task is to calculate the following descriptive statistics for the 'Value' column in the input DataFrame `df`:
    *   Mean
    *   Median
    *   Standard deviation
4.  The function should return a dictionary containing these statistics.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   How can you calculate other descriptive statistics, such as the mode, variance, and quartiles?
*   Explore the `describe()` function in Pandas, which provides a summary of the main descriptive statistics for a DataFrame.
*   How can you group the data by a categorical variable and calculate descriptive statistics for each group?
